<h1 id="securedrop-threat-model">SecureDrop Threat Model</h1>
<p>This document outlines the threat model for SecureDrop 0.3 and is inspired by the <a href="https://pond.imperialviolet.org/threat.html">threat model document Adam Langley wrote for Pond</a>. The threat model is defined in terms of what each possible adversary can achieve. This document is still a work in progress. If you have questions or comments, please open an issue on GitHub or send an email to securedrop@freedom.press.</p>

<li>The server stores only encrypted submissions and communication on disk.</li>
<li>The server stores a GPG key for each source, with the source's codename as the passphrase.</li>
<li>The server may <a href="https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/issues/802/pull/805">store plaintext submissions in memory for at most 24 hours</a>.</li>
<li>The server stores sanitized Tor logs, created using the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en">SafeLogging option</a>, for the Source Interface, the Document Interface, and SSH.</li>
<li>The server stores both access and error logs for the Document Interface.</li>
<li>The server stores connection history and audit logs for the admin.</li>
<li>The server can connect to the Monitor server using an SSH key and a passphrase.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-the-monitor-server-can-achieve">What the Monitor Server can achieve</h3>
<ul>
<li>The server stores the plaintext alerts on disk, data may also reside in RAM.</li>
<li>The server stores the GPG public key the OSSEC alerts are encrypted to.</li>
<li>The server stores plaintext credentials for the SMTP relay used to send OSSEC alerts.</li>
<li>The server stores the email address the encrypted OSSEC alerts are sent to.</li>
<li>The server stores sanitized Tor logs, created using the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en">SafeLogging option</a>, for SSH.</li>
<li>The server stores connection history and audit logs for the admin.</li>
<li>The server stores OSSEC and Procmail logs on disk.</li>
<li>The server can connect to the Application Server using an SSH key and a passphrase.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-the-workstations-can-achieve">What the Workstations can achieve</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Admin Workstation</strong> requires Tails with a persistent volume, which stores information such as GPG and SSH keys, as well as a <a href="../installation/install/#passphrase-database">database with passphrases</a> for the Application Server, the Monitor Server, and the GPG key the Monitor Server will encrypt OSSEC alerts to.</li>
<li>The <strong>Journalist Workstation</strong> requires Tails with a persistent volume, which stores information such as the Hidden Service value required to connect to the Document Interface, as well as a <a href="../installation/install/#passphrase-database">database with passphrases</a> for the Document Interface and the journalist's personal GPG key.</li>
<li>The <strong>Secure Viewing Station</strong> requires Tails with a persistent volume, which stores information such as the SecureDrop application's GPG key, as well as a <a href="../installation/install/#passphrase-database">database with the passphrase</a> for that key.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-a-compromise-of-the-sources-property-can-achieve">What a compromise of the source's property can achieve</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use of <a href="https://research.torproject.org/techreports/tbb-forensic-analysis-2013-06-28.pdf">the Tor Browser will leave traces</a> that can be discovered through a forensic analysis of the source's property following either a compromise or physical seizure. Unless the compromise or seizure happens while the source is submitting documents to SecureDrop, the traces will not include information about sites visited or actions performed in the browser.</li>
<li>Use of Tails with a persistent volume will leave traces on the device the operating system was installed on. Unless the compromise or seizure happens while the source is submitting documents to SecureDrop, or using the persistent volume, the traces will not include information about sites visited or actions performed in the browser or on the system.</li>
<li>SecureDrop 0.3 encourages sources to protect their codenames by memorizing them. If a source cannot memorize the codename right away, we recommend writing it down and keeping it in a safe place at first, and gradually working to memorize it over time. Once the source has memorized it, he or she should destroy the written copy. If the source does write down the codename, a compromise or physical seizure of the source's property may result in the attacker obtaining the source's codename.</li>
<li>An attacker with access to the <strong>source's codename</strong> can:<ul>
<li>Show that the source has visited the SecureDrop site, but not necessarily submitted anything.</li>
<li>Upload new documents or submit messages.</li>
<li>Communicate with the journalist as that source.</li>
<li>See any replies from journalists that the source has not yet deleted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-a-physical-seizure-of-the-sources-property-can-achieve">What a physical seizure of the source's property can achieve</h3>
<ul>
<li>Document use of Tor or Tails, but not necessarily research into SecureDrop</li>
<li>Prevent the source from submitting documents by taking the device the documents are stored on.</li>
<li>If the property is seized while powered on, the attacker can also analyze any plaintext information that resides in RAM.</li>
<li>Tamper with the hardware.</li>
<li>
<p>A physical seizure of, and access to, the source's codename will allow the attacker to access the Source Interface as that source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A physical seizure of the admin's property will allow the attacker to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevent the admin from working on SecureDrop for some period of time.</li>
<li>Access any stored, decrypted documents taken off the Secure Viewing Station.</li>
<li>If the property is seized while powered on, the attacker can also analyze any plaintext information that resides in RAM.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A physical seizure of, and access to, the admin's Tails persistent volume, password database, and two-factor authentication device will allow the attacker to access both servers and the Document Interface.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-a-compromise-of-the-admins-property-can-achieve">What a compromise of the admin's property can achieve</h3>
<ul>
<li>To access the Document Interface, the Application Server, or the Monitor Server, the attacker needs to obtain the admin's login credentials and the admin's two-factor authentication device. Unless the attacker has physical access to the servers, the attacker will also need to obtain the Hidden Service values for the Interface and the servers. This information is stored in a password-protected database in a persistent volume on the admin's Tails device. The volume is protected by a passphrase. If the admin's two-factor authentication device is a mobile phone, this will also be protected by a passphrase.</li>
<li>An attacker with access to the <strong>admin's computer</strong> can:<ul>
<li>Access any stored, decrypted documents taken off the Secure Viewing Station.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An attacker with access to the <strong>persistent volume</strong> on the admin's Tails device can:<ul>
<li>Add, modify, and delete files on the volume.</li>
<li>Access the Hidden Service values used by the Interfaces and the servers.</li>
<li>Access SSH keys and passphrases for the Application Server and the Monitor Server.</li>
<li>Access the GPG key and passphrase for the encrypted OSSEC email alerts.</li>
<li>Access the credentials for the account the encrypt alerts are sent to.</li>
<li>Access the admin's personal GPG key.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An attacker with admin access to the <strong>Document Interface</strong> can:<ul>
<li>Add, modify, and delete journalist users.</li>
<li>Change the codenames associated with sources within the Interface.</li>
<li>Download, but not decrypt, submissions.</li>
<li>Communicate with sources.</li>
<li>Delete one or more submissions.</li>
<li>Delete one or more sources, which destroys all communication with that source and prevents the source from ever logging back in with that codename.</li>
</ul>
</li>
